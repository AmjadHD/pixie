# Pixie - A full-featured 2D graphics library for Nim

⚠️ WARNING: This library is still in heavy development. ⚠️

Pixie is a 2D graphics library similar to [Cairo](https://www.cairographics.org/) and [Skia](https://skia.org) written (almost) entirely in Nim.

Features include:
* Drawing paths, shapes and curves
* Complex masking
* Shadows, glows and effects
* Loading image file formats (PNG, BMP, JPG + more in development)

This library is being actively developed and is not yet ready for use. Since you've managed to stumble onto it, give it a star and check back soon!
